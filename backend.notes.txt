# Auth Notes

- Tokens can be sent in 2 ways:
  1. In JSON (frontend stores in localStorage → XSS risk).
  2. In httpOnly cookies (browser auto-sends → safer for web).

- In my project:
  - loginUser sets both cookies and returns tokens in JSON.
  - verifyJWT checks token from cookies OR Authorization header.
  - If I want pure cookie-based auth → remove tokens from JSON response.

- Remember:
  - Cookies only get stored after response is sent.
  - Use httpOnly + secure + sameSite.
  - No need to expose tokens in JSON if relying on cookies.
