This approach will use a JSON Web Token (JWT). The flow is:

React: User clicks "Login with Google".

React -> Backend: The click is a simple link to a backend route (e.g., /auth/google).

Backend -> Google: Passport redirects the user to Google's consent screen.

Google -> Backend: Google redirects the user back to your server's callback route (/auth/google/callback) with a code.

Backend: Passport exchanges the code for the user's profile. It then finds or creates this user in your MongoDB database.

Backend: You create a JWT (JSON Web Token) for that user.

Backend -> React: The backend redirects the user back to your React app (e.g., /login-success) and includes the JWT in a URL query parameter.

React: A special component in your React app grabs the token from the URL, saves it to localStorage, and redirects the user to their dashboard.





1. we update the usermodel to store add google id and dont forget to update the presave , as we would not have a password in this case
