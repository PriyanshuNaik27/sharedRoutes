MUulter and cloudinary 
ðŸ”¹ Why do we need Multer if using Cloudinary?

Cloudinary (and other storage services) expect you to send them the file. But when a client uploads an image:

The file comes in the HTTP request body (binary data).

Express by default cannot handle file uploads.

Multer parses the incoming request and temporarily stores the file (in memory or disk).

Then, you can pass that file to Cloudinaryâ€™s upload API.

ðŸ”¹ Flow in a Node.js + Cloudinary setup

User uploads image from frontend.

Backend receives request â†’ Multer extracts the file.

Pass file buffer/path to Cloudinary uploader.

Cloudinary returns a public URL.

Save that URL in your database.

How Memory Storage Works:
Flow:
User uploads image â†’ Multer stores in RAM as buffer
We pass req.file.buffer directly to Cloudinary
Cloudinary uploads from memory â†’ No disk involved
We get back the Cloudinary URL
Buffer is automatically garbage collected
